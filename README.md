Draws the Norwegian Flag with tkinter (for a class assignment)

Attempts to follow the legal guidelines too (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Norway#Legal_definition)).
I am in no way affiliated with norway, just putting this here because i put way too much thought into it.

A little ghost from the hit game "PacMan". Don't DMCA me.
